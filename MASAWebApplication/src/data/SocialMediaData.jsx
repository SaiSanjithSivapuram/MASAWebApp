We were honored to have our Dean of the college of engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan - Dearborn, Dr Kridli, join us for our launch! Unfortunately and due to unforeseen weather conditions, we weren‚Äôt able to launch. We are glad to have come to the launch site, learnt a lot, and got ready to launch! Stay tuned for our rocket launch!

            postText: "On February 9, 2019 we launched TR3.1! This rocket featured a pressure sensing experiment, which we hope to implement in the full-scale rocket: this will help us determine the angle of attack of the rocket during its ascent. On this day we also ground-tested two other experimental projects: the Drogue Mortar, and Smoke Trail system. The Drogue Mortar serves to simplify recovery events by radially ejecting a parachute, and the smoke trail system will aid in visually spotting the full scale rocket when it's 8000+ feet in the air. Thank you all for your support. Go Blue! #test #rockets #rocketry #goblue #engineering #nasa",
